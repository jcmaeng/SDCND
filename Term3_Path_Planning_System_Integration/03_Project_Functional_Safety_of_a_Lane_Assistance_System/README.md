### 1.Goals

 Create functional safety documents of Lane Assistance System. These documents are simplified versions of what a functional safety manager would create as part of a safety case. A safety case is a collection of documents proving that a project has made a vehicle safer.

### 2.The deliverables
* Safety Plan
* Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment
* Functional Safety Concept
* Technical Safety Concept
* Software Safety Requirements and Architecture

### 3.Description of Lane Assistance System
The Lane Assistance System will have two functions:
1. Lane departure warning(LDW)<br>
The lane departure warning function shall apply an oscillating steering torque to provide the driver a haptic feedback.
2. Lane keeping assistance(LKA)<br>
