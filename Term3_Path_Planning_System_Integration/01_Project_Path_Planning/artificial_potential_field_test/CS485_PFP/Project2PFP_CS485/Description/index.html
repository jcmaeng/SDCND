<h1>Project 2: Potential Field Planning for a Rigid Body Robot</h1>
<center>

<div class="contents">

<h2><a class="anchor" name="impNotesRigidBody">
Summary: </a></h2>


<ul>
<li>Implement potential field planners
in the case of <b><em>rigid bodies (80pts) </em></b></li>
<li>Your implementation should also contain strategies for escaping
  local minima when the robot gets stuck <b>(20pts)</b>. One possibility is to
  considerably increase the repulsive potential in order to push the robot away
  from the obstacle. Another one is to move in a random direction
  away from the obstacle. You could also try adding other artificial
  goal/obstacle points to guide the robot away from the real
  obstacles and toward the real goal.</li>

<li>Project is graded out of 100 points</li>
<li>You can work by yourself or with a partner of your own choice</li>
<li>Implementation should be in C/C++ or Matlab on top of the provided support code</li>
</ul>

<p>
Environment consists of a robot, a goal region represented as a
circle, and several obstacles represented as circles as
well. Graphical interface supports the dynamic addition and
displacement of obstacles and goal. A new obstacle can be added at any
time by pressing down the left-button of the mouse. Each obstacle and
the goal can be moved around by clicking inside them and holding the
left-button down while moving the mouse.  To run the planner, user
needs to press the key 'p' on the keyboard. Pressing 'p' again toggles
between running and stopping the planner. User can change the radius
of each obstacle and the goal by first pressing the key 'r' and then
clicking inside an obstacle/goal, holding the left-button down while
moving the mouse.  Pressing 'r' again toggles between editing radius
or moving the obstacles and the goal.

Implementation Notes: </a></h2>


<p>
Simulator provides access to goal center, goal radius, number of
obstacles, current robot configuration (robot x, robot y, robot
theta), and vertices of the polygon representing the robot.
Simulator also computes the closest point on the i-th obstacle for any
given point (x, y), see function <b>ClosestPointOnObstacle</b>
</p>

<p>
When computing the potential, it is recommended that you use each
vertex of the polygon robot as a control point. 
<ul>
<li>
For each control
point (xj, yj), you should then
<ul>
<li>compute its Jacobian matrix Jac<sub>j</sub></li>
<li>compute the workspace gradient (wsg<sub>i</sub>) to each obstacle
  [In my implementation, wsg<sub>i</sub> is zero if  the
  distance from (xj, yj) to the closest point on the i-th obstacle is larger than a
  small constant. I then scale the gradient in order to ensure that
  the robot gets pushed away when coming 
  close to the obstacles. You may need to play around in order to
  figure out by how much to scale the gradient in order to get the
  desired behavior.]</li>
<li> use the Jacobian matrix to transform wsg<sub>i</sub> into a
  configuration space gradient csg<sub>i</sub></li>
<li>add the configuration space gradient csg<sub>i</sub> to the
  overall configuration space gradient csg</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now that the overall configuration space gradient has been
  computed, scale it so that you make a small move in x and y and a
  small move in theta. Recall that the robot should always move in
  direction opposite to the gradient. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If using <b>C++</b> support code, you should implement the
function <b>ConfigurationMove</b> in the
class <b>RigidBodyPlanner.</b> This function should
return <b>RigidBodyMove</b>, which represents a small move (dx, dy,
dtheta) by the robot.
